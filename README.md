👋 Hi, I'm **Warda Hasan**, a **Computer Engineering graduate** from 🎓 **American University of Sharjah (AUS)** with a strong foundation in **Software Engineering** and **AI/ML**.  
I design and build **innovative, intelligent systems** that combine backend logic, seamless frontend experiences, and applied machine learning.  

I’ve worked across the **entire software development lifecycle (SDLC)** — from requirements gathering and design to coding, testing, and deployment.  
My AI experience spans both **AI system integration** — using **OpenAI API** and **prompt engineering** — and **machine learning research**, including **model training, data preprocessing, and feature analysis** for projects in **prediction and data science**.  

Welcome to my GitHub!  
Here you’ll find my **project folders**, each highlighting a chapter of my journey across **software engineering**, **AI systems**, and **data science**.
